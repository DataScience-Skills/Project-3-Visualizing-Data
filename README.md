## The Great Freeze - Texas Energy Prices Across Sectors:
- There are defining moments in time, and one hits the State of Texas on __Date of the 'Great Freeze'__ with an outlier extreme weather condition, a great freeze, which affected energy generation across all sectors. News reports from the time stated, "excerpt 1", "excerpt 2", and more. This event brought together five data dscience specialists, making up Jardo Analytics, Inc. to understand better what caused such failure...
- We are interested in analyzing the energy infrastructure of Texas. Texas has its own energy grid, being the LONE star state and all, and with this summer's heat wave bearing down on us, we reasoned it will be beneificial to understand the energy grid better and how it correlates to weather patterns over time. Thus, we are analyzing data from the EIA and  (other energy source(s)? and some weather source(s)).
