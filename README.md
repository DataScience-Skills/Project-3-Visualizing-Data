# Project-3-Visualizing-Data
Bootcamp: UTA-VIRT-DATA-PT-02-2023-U-LOLC-MWTH(B) Project 3

## The Great Freeze - Texas Energy Prices Across Sectors:
- There are defining moments in time, and one hits the State of Texas on __Date of the 'Great Freeze'__ with an outlier extreme weather condition, a great freeze, which affected energy generation across all sectors. News reports from the time stated, "excerpt 1", "excerpt 2", and more. This event brought together five data dscience specialists, making up Jardo Analytics, Inc. to understand better what caused such failure...
- ● A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale:
  - We are interested in analyzing the energy infrastructure of Texas. Texas has its own energy grid, being the LONE star state and all, and with this summer's heat wave bearing down on us, we reasoned it will be beneificial to understand the energy grid better and how it correlates to weather patterns over time. Thus, we are analyzing data from the EIA and  (other energy source(s)? and some weather source(s)).
- ● A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata, if it exists.
  - Our dataset(s) can be found here: <link> 
- ● Three or four screenshots of relevant, “inspiring” visualizations that show your creative ideas
  - Screenshot 1: "To be or not to be"
  - Screenshot 2: "Energizer Bunny"
  - Screenshot 3: "Always look on the bright side of life"
  - Screenshot 4: "Whether weather weathers is weathersome"
- ● A sketch of the final dwesign
  - ... finally, so sketchy!
- ● A link to the primary GitHub repository where you’ll be housing your work

## Proposed Steps:
  - Identify the problem
  - Generate the questions
  - Decide which visualizations to show
  - Pull the data
  - Format the data 

## Completed:
- Create a shared GitHub Repo
- Create branches:
  - [x] main
  - [x] API
  - [x] Data 
  - [x] Database
  - [x] Interactive-Visualizations
  - [x] Javascript
  - [x] Maps
  - [x] Webscraping
- Schedule days and times to meet:
  - We can use the shared Zoom link here in Slack/study-groups
- Choose a topic(s):
  - Patent
  - Music
  - Entertainment
  - OpenSource (Wikipedia)
  - Recreation
- Each team member chooses a branch
- Work on branches:
  - help each other as needed
  - Merge branches
- Google Slides presentation
- Practice Presentation
- Present!
